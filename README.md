# Graph algorithms | Graphs Theory 
Project for the Graph Theory course with the purpose of presenting four algorithms using the concepts given in class. Valid for the 3rd semester of the Computer Science course at the Federal University of Alagoas, a subject taught by professor Rian Gabriel Pinheiro.

## Algorithms

1. **Prim's Algorithm**: A greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.
2. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Another greedy algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree, but it works on connected, undirected graphs as well.
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: A popular algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted, directed graph.
4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: A versatile algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source to all other vertices, even in graphs with negative weight edges.

##How to execute?

1. Compile a class of the desired algorithm in the algorithm folder. To do this, use the command:


  ```make dijkstra```
  
  ```make bellman```
  
  ```make prim```
  
  ```make kruskal```

  2. If you want help, fo any of the next things in your bash:

```
  -h : show help
  -o <file> : make a file with awnsers
  -f <file> : choose the input of algorithm
  -s : show awnser
```

3. Run the program acording the tip 2 and be happpy:

    ```./<algoritm>.bin -f input.mtx```
